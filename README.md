                  Project Description – Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Transformers & LSTM-Attention

    This project is a complete, end-to-end implementation of a deep learning workflow for multivariate time series forecasting. 
It was built to understand how modern neural network architectures—especially 
Transformers and LSTM models enhanced with attention mechanisms—can be applied to forecast future values from historical sequential data.
    The work begins by generating a synthetic multivariate dataset. Instead of relying on an external source, the project creates its own data with controlled characteristics such as long-term trends, multiple seasonal patterns, and realistic noise. Each feature in the dataset behaves differently, which helps in testing how well the models handle complex temporal relationships.
